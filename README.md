Bus simulation by SIMDL and GPSS

In this project, the problem given below will be simulated.

A party of 100 people has been taken to a football game in four buses, each of capacity 25. When the game is over, each person returns independently to the bus that brought him to the game. The time taken to reach a bus is normally distributed with mean values of 10, 12, 15 and 18 minutes for the four buses. When a bus is full, it leaves, and arrives home after a drive that is normally distributed with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 5 minutes. Begin a simulation from the time the game finishes and find the time at which the last bus arrives home.
